- Clean up component structure/project directory layout
- Add auto complete functionality(like google.com) (hard)
- clicking enter should perform same behavior as clicking button
- handle loading
- handle errors on retrieval of data so user can react
- Add more 'emberish' functionality, ideally with computed properties
- Cache results from api(recording/mock api)
- subclass Ember.TextField OR create custom text field component to handle autocomplete? (use Ember.run.debounce to query every 350 ms on keystrokes during search)


- why does model id go to one, how to fix?
- homepage loading?
